We present a computer program, MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO, capable of handling all these computations -- parton-level fixed order, shower-matched, merged -- in a unified framework whose defining features are flexibility, high level of parallelisation, and human intervention limited to input physics quantities. We demonstrate the potential of the program by presenting selected phenomenological applications relevant to the LHC and to a 1-TeV \$e\^+e\^-\$ collider. While next-to-leading order results are restricted to QCD corrections to SM processes in the first public version, we show that from the user viewpoint no changes have to be expected in the case of corrections due to any given renormalisable Lagrangian, and that the implementation of these are well under way.},

  abstract = {We present a new set of parton distributions, NNPDF3.1, which updates NNPDF3.0, the first global set of PDFs determined using a methodology validated by a closure test. The update is motivated by recent progress in methodology and available data, and involves both. On the methodological side, we now parametrize and determine the charm PDF alongside the light-quark and gluon ones, thereby increasing from seven to eight the number of independent PDFs. On the data side, we now include the D0 electron and muon W asymmetries from the final Tevatron dataset, the complete LHCb measurements of W and Z production in the forward region at 7 and 8 TeV, and new ATLAS and CMS measurements of inclusive jet and electroweak boson production. We also include for the first time top-quark pair differential distributions and the transverse momentum of the Z bosons from ATLAS and CMS. We investigate the impact of parametrizing charm and provide evidence that the accuracy and stability of the PDFs are thereby improved. We study the impact of the new data by producing a variety of determinations based on reduced datasets. We find that both improvements have a significant impact on the PDFs, with some substantial reductions in uncertainties, but with the new PDFs generally in agreement with the previous set at the one-sigma level. The most significant changes are seen in the light-quark flavor separation, and in increased precision in the determination of the gluon. We explore the implications of NNPDF3.1 for LHC phenomenology at Run II, compare with recent LHC measurements at 13 TeV, provide updated predictions for Higgs production cross-sections and discuss the strangeness and charm content of the proton in light of our improved dataset and methodology. The NNPDF3.1 PDFs are delivered for the first time both as Hessian sets, and as optimized Monte Carlo sets with a compressed number of replicas.},

This ``anti-k\_t'' algorithm essentially behaves like an idealised cone algorithm, in that jets with only soft fragmentation are conical, active and passive areas are equal, the area anomalous dimensions are zero, the non-global logarithms are those of a rigid boundary and the Milan factor is universal. None of these properties hold for existing sequential recombination algorithms, nor for cone algorithms with split--merge steps, such as SISCone. They are however the identifying characteristics of the collinear unsafe plain ``iterative cone'' algorithm, for which the anti-k\_t algorithm provides a natural, fast, infrared and collinear safe replacement.},

Physics objects that can be used for data analysis are then reconstructed from the simulated detector response. These include tracks and calorimeter deposits and high level objects such as isolated electrons, jets, taus, and missing energy. The new modular approach allows for greater flexibility in the design of the simulation and reconstruction sequence. New features such as the particle-flow reconstruction approach, crucial in the first years of the LHC, and pile-up simulation and mitigation, which is needed for the simulation of the LHC detectors in the near future, have also been implemented. The DELPHES framework is not meant to be used for advanced detector studies, for which more accurate tools are needed.

  abstract = {In high-energy physics, with the search for ever smaller signals in ever larger data sets, it has become essential to extract a maximum of the available information from the data. Multivariate classification methods based on machine learning techniques have become a fundamental ingredient to most analyses. Also the multivariate classifiers themselves have significantly evolved in recent years. Statisticians have found new ways to tune and to combine classifiers to further gain in performance. Integrated into the analysis framework ROOT, TMVA is a toolkit which hosts a large variety of multivariate classification algorithms. Training, testing, performance evaluation and application of all available classifiers is carried out simultaneously via user-friendly interfaces. With version 4, TMVA has been extended to multivariate regression of a real-valued target vector. Regression is invoked through the same user interfaces as classification. TMVA 4 also features more flexible data handling allowing one to arbitrarily form combined MVA methods. A generalised boosting method is the first realisation benefiting from the new framework.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new jet substructure technique called "soft drop declustering", which recursively removes soft wide-angle radiation from a jet. The soft drop algorithm depends on two parameters--a soft threshold \$z\_\textbackslash text\{cut\}\$ and an angular exponent \$\textbackslash beta\$--with the \$\textbackslash beta = 0\$ limit corresponding roughly to the (modified) mass drop procedure. To gain an analytic understanding of soft drop and highlight the \$\textbackslash beta\$ dependence, we perform resummed calculations for three observables on soft-dropped jets: the energy correlation functions, the groomed jet radius, and the energy loss due to soft drop. The \$\textbackslash beta = 0\$ limit of the energy loss is particularly interesting, since it is not only "Sudakov safe" but also largely insensitive to the value of the strong coupling constant. While our calculations are strictly accurate only to modified leading-logarithmic order, we also include a discussion of higher-order effects such as multiple emissions and (the absence of) non-global logarithms. We compare our analytic results to parton shower simulations and find good agreement, and we also estimate the impact of non-perturbative effects such as hadronization and the underlying event. Finally, we demonstrate how soft drop can be used for tagging boosted W bosons, and we speculate on the potential advantages of using soft drop for pileup mitigation.},

In this study, we focus on a type-II two Higgs doublet model (2HDM-II) and consider a heavy charged Higgs with its mass ranging from 500 GeV to 1 TeV as dictated by the \$b\textbackslash to s\textbackslash gamma\$ constraints which render \$M\_\{H\^\textbackslash pm\}{$>$}480\$ GeV. We study the dominant production mode \$H\^\textbackslash pm t\$ associated production with \$H\^\textbackslash pm \textbackslash to W\^\textbackslash pm A\$ being the dominant decay channel when the pseudoscalar \$A\$ is considerably lighter. For such a heavy charged Higgs, both the decay products \$W\^\textbackslash pm\$ and \$A\$ are relatively boosted. In such a scenario, we apply the jet substructure analysis of tagging the fat pseudoscalar and \$W\$ jets in order to eliminate the standard model background efficiently. We perform a detailed detector simulation for the signal and background processes at the 14 TeV LHC. We introduce various kinematical cuts to determine the signal significance for a number of benchmark points with charged Higgs boson mass from 500 GeV to 1 TeV in the \$W\^\textbackslash pm A\$ decay channel. Finally we perform a multivariate analysis utilizing a boosted decision tree algorithm to optimize these significances.},

  abstract = {The top quark, discovered at the FERMILAB TEVATRON collider in 1995, is the heaviest known elementary particle. Today, ten years later, still relatively little is known about its properties. The strong and weak interactions of the top quark are not nearly as well studied as those of the other quarks and leptons. The strong interaction is most directly measured in top quark pair production. The weak interaction is measured in top quark decay and single top quark production, which remains thus far unobserved. The large top-quark mass of about 175 GeV/c\textsuperscript{2{$<$}sup/{$>$} suggests that it may play a special role in nature. It behaves differently from all other quarks due to its large mass and its correspondingly short lifetime. The top quark decays before it hadronises, passing its spin information on to its decay products. Therefore, it is possible to measure observables that depend on the top quark spin, providing a unique environment for tests of the Standard Model and for searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. This report summarises the latest measurements and studies of top quark properties and rare decays from the TEVATRON in Run II. With more than 1 fb\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$} of luminosity delivered to each experiment, CDF and DO, top quark physics at the TEVATRON is at a turning point from first studies to precision measurements with sensitivity to new physics. An outlook onto top quark physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, planned to begin operation in the year 2007, is also given.}}},

  abstract = {Jet vetoes are essential in many Higgs and new-physics analyses at the LHC and Tevatron. The signals are typically characterized by a specific number of hard jets, leptons, or photons, while the backgrounds often have additional jets. In such cases vetoing undesired additional jets is an effective way to discriminate signals and background. Given an inclusive event sample with N or more jets, the veto to have only N energetic jets defines an "exclusive" N-jet cross section. This strongly restricts the phase space of the underlying inclusive N-jet cross section and causes large double logarithms in perturbation theory that must be summed to obtain theory predictions. Jet vetoes are typically implemented using jet algorithms. This yields complicated phase-space restrictions and one often relies on parton-shower Monte Carlos, which are limited to leading-logarithmic accuracy. We introduce a global event shape "N-jettiness", tau\_N, which is defined for events with N signal jets and vanishes in the limit of exactly N infinitely narrow jets. Requiring tau\_N {$<<$} 1 constrains radiation between the N signal jets and vetoes additional undesired jets. This provides an inclusive method to veto jets and to define an exclusive N-jet cross section that can be well-controlled theoretically. N-jettiness yields a factorization formula with inclusive jet and beam functions.},

  abstract = {N -subjettiness is a jet shape designed to identify boosted hadronic objects such as top quarks. Given N subjet axes within a jet, N-subjettiness sums the angular distances of jet constituents to their nearest subjet axis. Here, we generalize and improve on N -subjettiness by minimizing over all possible subjet directions, using a new variant of the k-means clustering algorithm. On boosted top benchmark samples from the BOOST2010 workshop, we demonstrate that a simple cut on the 3-subjettiness to 2-subjettiness ratio yields 20\% (50\%) tagging efficiency for a 0.23\% (4.1\%) fake rate, making N -subjettiness a highly effective boosted top tagger. N-subjettiness can be modified by adjusting an angular weighting exponent, and we find that the jet broadening measure is preferred for boosted top searches. We also explore multivariate techniques, and show that additional improvements are possible using a modified Fisher discriminant. Finally, we briefly mention how our minimization procedure can be extended to the entire event, allowing the event shape N-jettiness to act as a fixed N cone jet algorithm.},
