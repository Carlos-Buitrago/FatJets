\hypsection{Generation of signal and background events}
\vspace{20pt}

The Monte Carlo samples used in the analysis are produced using a generation chain involving multiple steps involving different software. Both signal and background event generation consist of the same steps. Different samples are produced separately in order to obtain the respective signal and background datasets. Two signal processes will be considered, the first one is used to study the tagging of boosted top quarks and the second one to study the tagging of boosted $W$ bosons. These signal samples will be used together with a single QCD background sample of light quarks and gluons, taking into account the discussion of section \ref{sect:substructure}.\\


The generation chain begins with the generation of matrix elements at leading order (LO) in QCD and electroweak couplings using \textsc{MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO} v2.9.12 \cite{Alwall2014} with the \textsc{NN23LO1} PDF set \cite{Ball2017}. The process defined to produce the signal top jets consists of top quarks decaying in the entirely hadronic channel $pp \rightarrow t \tilde{t}$, ($t \rightarrow W^+ b$, $W^+ \rightarrow jj$), ($\tilde{t} \rightarrow W^- \tilde{b}$, $W^- \rightarrow jj$). On the other hand, the process used to produce the background sample is the default QCD production dijet production routine $pp \rightarrow jj$ where the $j$ jets are composed of light quarks ($b$'s included) and gluons.\\

After the amplitudes and mappings for the relevant processes have been obtained they are passed to \textsc{MadEvent} \cite{Maltoni2003}, which generates the unweighted tree-level Les Houches events. Both signal and background datasets consist of 500000 events generated at a centre-of-mass energy of 14\;TeV. During the event generation stage, a parton-level momentum phase space cut is implemented on all partons in order to reduce computing time for the simulations. Only boosted particles are of interest for this study, and the parton-level cut allows more fat jets to be produced in the established number of events. The cut used is $p_T > 350$\;GeV and it applies at parton-level to both gluons and light quarks, as well as $W$ bosons and top quarks. \textbf{This initial $p_T$ cut value is later increased for subsequent analyses.}\\

The tree-level events are showered using \textsc{Pythia} v8.306 \cite{Sjostrand2015} with the default settings proposed in the \textsc{MadGraph5}'s implementation of \textsc{Pythia 8} in order to obtain hadron-level events in \textsc{HEPMC} format \cite{Dobbs2001}. Subsequently, the detector response is simulated via \textsc{Delphes} v3.5.0 \cite{deFavereau2014} using the default ATLAS detector configuration card with the inclusion of the fat jet reconstruction module provided by the \textsc{FastJet} v3.3.4 library \cite{Cacciari2012}.\\

The fat jets used in the analysis are reconstructed via \textsc{FastJet} using the anti-$k_T$ algorithm with $R =$ 1.0, \textbf{(this radius parameter is later increased for subsequent analyses)}. The $\tau_N$ values associated to each fat jet are computed from the three-momenta of $N$ candidate subjets using the $N$-subjettiness package (v2.2.6) of the \textsc{FastJet} contrib v1.051. In order to obtain the candidate subjets needed for the $\tau_N$ computations the fat jet is reclustered with an exclusive $k_T$ algorithm \cite{Khelifa-Kerfa2022}.\\

At high luminosity hadron colliders such as the LHC, the presence of pile-up energy and the underlying event interferes in analyses involving large $R$ jets because they lead to soft, wide-angle contaminations which lead to the dilution of the jet substructure. Grooming techniques are useful to remove these contaminations. The grooming methods applied to the jets reconstructed in this analysis are trimming \cite{Krohn2010}, pruning \cite{Ellis2009} and soft-dropping \cite{Larkoski2014} algorithms. These methods are implemented via \textsc{FastJet} integration, using the default parameters in the ATLAS configuration card of \textsc{Delphes 3}. This selection of parameters is done based on various studies that have been carried out previously in order to compare and optimize the performance of the different methods.\\

It should be noted that the description of the event generation process described above also applies for the generation of the signal sample used to study the tagging of boosted $W$ bosons. In this case the process used for the tree-level event generation is $W$ pair production, with each $W$ decaying in the full hadronic channel $pp \rightarrow W^{+}W^{-}$, ($W^{+} \rightarrow jj$), ($W^{-} \rightarrow jj$), where the $j$ jets are defined as in the process used to produce the background sample.\\
