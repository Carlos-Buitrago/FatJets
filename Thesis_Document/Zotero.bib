  abstract = {The k\_t and Cambridge/Aachen inclusive jet finding algorithms for hadron-hadron collisions can be seen as belonging to a broader class of sequential recombination jet algorithms, parametrised by the power of the energy scale in the distance measure. We examine some properties of a new member of this class, for which the power is negative. This ``anti-k\_t'' algorithm essentially behaves like an idealised cone algorithm, in that jets with only soft fragmentation are conical, active and passive areas are equal, the area anomalous dimensions are zero, the non-global logarithms are those of a rigid boundary and the Milan factor is universal. None of these properties hold for existing sequential recombination algorithms, nor for cone algorithms with split--merge steps, such as SISCone. They are however the identifying characteristics of the collinear unsafe plain ``iterative cone'' algorithm, for which the anti-k\_t algorithm provides a natural, fast, infrared and collinear safe replacement.},

Aside from extensive treatments of the renormalization group technique, The operator product expansion formalism and their applications to short-distance reactions, this book provides a comprehensive introduction to gauge theories. Examples and exercises are provided to amplify the discussions on important topics. This is an ideal textbook on the subject of quantum chromodynamics and is essential for researchers and graduate students in high energy physics, nuclear physics and mathematical physics.},

My hope is that it will serve both as a primer for the newcomer to jets and as a quick reference for those with some experience of the subject. It is devoted to the questions of how one defines jets, how jets relate to partons, and to the emerging subject of how best to use jets at the LHC.},

We find that two-jet events dominate the cross section at high energy, and have the experimentally observed angular distribution. Estimates are given for the jet angular radius and its energy dependence. We argue that the detailed results of perturbation theory for production of arbitrary numbers of quarks and gluons can be reinterpreted in quantum chromodynamics as predictions for the production of jets.},
